# Merge Pile  

**Merge Pile** is a puzzle game I developed during my internship at **Furtle Game**.  
In this project, I used the **Mobile Game Template** that I had previously created.  

> 📌 The game assets used in **Merge Pile** are pre-made assets and are not commercially produced.

## 🛠️ Level Editor  

While developing the game, I created a **Level Editor Tool** to design and manage levels efficiently.
